Colin is lounging comfortably against the rough wood of the French palisade. His eyes are closed, and a wide grin fills his face as he nibbles on a bit of cheese.

A kick to his side sends the cheese tumbling to the ground. With an irritable scowl, he peeks through a half opened eye to see a mouse shaped shadow blotting out the sun.

"Thomas, you really ought to work out more. I barely felt that one." Thomas leans forward and his lengthy whiskers brush Colins face.

"Get up you glus." Thomas let's his whiskers hang just a moment longer before standing upright. It was unnecessary, but he really enjoyed the look of discomfort on Colin's face. "Or are you going to spend the whole battle stuffing your face." he finishes.

Colin closes his eyes in answer to Thomas's insults, and let's out a long sigh.

"I suppose you're right Thomas. Wouldn't want to miss all the fun." With exaggerated effort, Colin stands up and picks up the last bite of cheese from the ground.

"Wouldn't want any to go to waste," Colins says. Without another word he pops the cheese in his mouth and strides off towards the rest of the group.

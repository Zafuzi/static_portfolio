So to save myself a migraine, I just copied Google.</p><p>I started off importing some basic polymer elements, and styling the page to look like a Google search page. I make the links all look the same, the padding, the margins, everything.</p><p>Eventually I settled on this design, and as it turns out, I actually love it. It has a certain minimalism that I have always aspired for, and I think it accurately sums up the way I feel about web pages in general. </p><p>For example the main header is large, but not too large, and does a great job of presenting important information. My projects are all neatly aligned and not bogged down by images that no one wants to see anyway.</p><p>Plus the card style leaves me plenty of room to experiment with menus, asides, and maybe even a footer( but probably not ). Above all else, I really enjoyed making this page, and I hope that you enjoyed seeing it as well.</p><p>See ya later, </p><p>-Zach</p>"
